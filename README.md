# Final Part 1


The code for the first part of the Final Project calculates Pi by
calculating the perimeter of polygons with increasing number of sides, until it has n-sides to 
accurately depict the perimeter of a circle. The main code was provided by our professor Dr. Michael Rozman.
The point of this code was to fix the original problem discovered in class, which calculated the half-angle sine for a given value of sine. This resulted in large error values for polygons with sides increasing past 2^15. This error has now been corrected and can accurately depict the value of Pi as seen from the graph provided.
